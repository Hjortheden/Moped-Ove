This module implements a server which can receive images from clients. The images are saved on the server,
and are processed using Optipos to get a position, which is sent back to the client.

The code is inspired by:
http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.9/recipes1.html#capturing-to-a-network-stream
The web server part uses code from:
http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?269125-Auto-Refresh-an-Image-only.

The web service protocol of the server is:
GET /index - returns a html page listing the MAC addresses of all devices that have connected, with links to specific information and showing which map they are using
GET /downloadimage?mac=m&view=v - returns a html page showing the latest image from the MAC address m, showing the view no v
POST /processimage?mac=m <image data> - uploads an image from MAC address m, return the position calculated by OptiPos
POST /selectmap?mac=m&map=f - tells the processing algorithm to use the map with filename f for data from MAC address m (assuming file f is already on the server)

STATUS:
Viewing images does not support several views.
Creating the index page from the Connected directory remains.

Installation: 
OpenCV 3.0 can be installed directly as binary for python. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26489867/opencv-for-python-3-x-under-windows.
