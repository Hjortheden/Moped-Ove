This supposes that you already have a development environment for Android.

WirelessIno is a modification of https://github.com/MiichaelD/BluIno

cd WirelessIno
To get a build.xml, do
export PATH=$PATH:~/android/android-sdk-linux/tools:~/android/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
android update project --subprojects --path . --target 9
Then
rm -r bin
ant debug

Put this on an Android phone somehow, via USB cable or a local web server.


The app doesn't detect loss of connection immediately, but it does if any
value is changed.

Tapping on the circle at the top sends a message to the car. The car
puts the message on the CAN bus with destination TCU, so it can be
read and acted on by the navigation code.

The screen turns around if you turn the phone, as with many apps, but
it will not do this if the controls are in a non-zero position.

For the latest version of Android, I made a change to the code, so
that the main thread is still allowed to do I/O, although it has
become deprecated. The code ought to be reorganized.
