The car should be powered with about 8.4 V DC. This can be done either
with a LiPo battery or a DC power supply.

On the voltage regulator (UBEC), there are four lights, showing the
voltage. When all four are steadily on, the voltage is fine. When only
the red ones are lit, the battery will soon run out (then all lights
will flicker).

Only two red lights are lit in the interval 6.6-7.2V. One will flicker for
a short while and then go out. Then it's time to turn off.

How the voltage sinks with time is shown in the picture

Plugin code on the VCU can read the voltage level from port 7.

The command
    tvservice -o
can be used on the TCU to turn off video output and lower battery
consumption.


* Charging the battery

Follow the instructions carefully (On moped.sics.se, MOPED Configuration ->
Hardware Configuration -> Battery Charging, and the manual for the charger).

It may happen that a battery which has been depleted so much that it
can't power the RPi's anymore will elicit the message "low voltage" or
something similar from the charger, which will then refuse to charge
it. In that case, it has almost always helped so far to simply wait a
few hours before trying again.

Charging a battery fully which has been depleted so that the RPi's
can't run anymore (it's then between 5.7 and 6.6 V) takes between 65
and 75 minutes.
