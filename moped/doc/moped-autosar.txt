Here those files in the autosar source tree are listed which contain
the MOPED additions to autosar, especially those which may be
interesting to change.

Under moped/autosar/src, there are two directories: core and examples.
"examples" contains what is specific for VCU and for SCU (although
with many files in common), whereas "core" contains what is common to
all autosar nodes.

Under "core", there are specific trees for the various architectures.

autosar/src/core/arch/arm/arm_v6/
autosar/src/core/arch/arm/arm_v7/

These trees have most files in common, but a small set are different.
arm_v7 is for Raspberry Pi 3, and v6 is for Raspberry Pi 1, which was used
in the earlier generation of cars.

    bcm2835.h
