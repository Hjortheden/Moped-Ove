* Speeding up building server

Extract all maven repository files (in ~/.m2) to ~/jar-files
Then run original-server:
Delete our own jar files: server, ecm*, simulator
and there are three log4j, where only one is needed
java -cp ~/jar-files/'*':target/server.jar service.PluginWebServicePublisher
Remove the shade thing in pom.xml and the building takes half the time.
add this to how-to-build.txt

mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

MQTT

The VCU/SCU writes to a port, which sends the data to TCU, which sends it
out (publishes).

The address of the MQTT server is specified by MQTTHOST in settings.properties.

A template is defined in ecm-linux/.../Main.java and
simulator/.../CarFactory.java, which consists of a JSON structure. It
is filled in with the key and value of what is written to the part in
the form "key|value".

At SICS, we have used names under /sics/moped. In order not to clash,
change this to something of your own.

Two public servers we have often used are:
test.mosquitto.org
iot.eclipse.org

It often happens that one of them is not available.

============================================================

VCU and SCU have numbers: 2 = VCU and 3 = SCU. When relevant, 1 = TCU.

============================================================

Tips and tricks

If only the SCU (or VCU) needs to be restarted (because it got stuck,
or because its SD card needs to be updated), pull its power cable and
put it in again.

The dependencies within the modules are far from understood, so it's
best to always (yes, always) do a 'clean' operation before rebuilding.

============================================================

If squawk is rebuilt, and a new kernel.img put on the VCU/SCU, all plugins
for that node need to be rebuilt, since their "hash codes" need to
coincide.

============================================================

When debugging the code on the VCU/SCU, printouts are normally not harmful,
but if they are performed very fast (deep inside the runtime system),
or in a sensitive place where they themselves may cause recursion
(memory allocation, symbol lookup), they may either hang the VCU/SCU
completely or make it behave erratically.

At least for the communication between TCU and SCU/VCU, timing cannot
be changed completely arbitrarily, because there is no flow control between
PIRTE and the code transferring data from the CAN bus.

In Java, printing is done with VM.print or VM.println, whereas System.out
is ignored on autosar. The VM functions work on hosted platforms too,
though. So always use the VM functions in plugins.

============================================================

Useful commands on TCU:

gpio readall (displays the layout of the pins)
/home/pi/can-utils/candump -td can0 (shows the CAN traffic)


============================================================

How CAN messages go

SCU 		 TCU		VCU
  <-- 1602 ---	    --- 1601 -->		plugin (un)installation

  --- 1292 --->	    <-- 1284 ---		plugin (un)installation ack

		    ---  257 -->		motor/servo

		    --- 1025 -->		position (raw)

  <-- 1130 ---	    --- 1129 -->		MQTT subscription

  --- 1132 --->	    <-- 1124 ---		MQTT publishing (cantp)

  ------------- 1121 ---------->		data
  <------------ 1122 -----------		data

To send a large data chunk with CAN, the protocol cantp has been devised,
and is partly used here. It's not true cantp, because then resending dropped
packets is included.

ecm-linux/canConfig.xml
autosar/src/examples/Raspberry_Pi/demo_VCU/config/Raspberry_Pi/CanIf_PBCfg.c
autosar/src/examples/Raspberry_Pi/demo_VCU/config/Raspberry_Pi/Can_PBcfg.c

The "MQTT subscription" is not actually in use. See IoTIMessageHandler.java.

TCU also sends to itself using 1124 (kludge), to transmit the button
press from the Android app to the CAN bus so the navigation code can
read it.

The navigation code on TCU also uses a kludge to send commands to a
plugin on the VCU, namely 1121, as if it came from the SCU.

VCU misuses uninstallation ack messages to send speed information
(with a fake plugin id), which the navigation code on TCU reads from
the CAN bus.

Hint: if a plugin drives the motor but doesn't set it to zero often,
the ESC may not start directly when turned off and on again. Then
using the remote control, move the speed to non-zero and then back
to zero.
